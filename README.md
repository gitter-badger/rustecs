## What is it?

An [Entity-component-system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)
written in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org).


## Is it any good?

Partially. It's incomplete, undocumented, unpolished and no mind has been paid
to performance. However, it works. If you're adventurous, go ahead and use it.


## Where can I get started?

There are unit tests, which serve as the only documentation currently:
